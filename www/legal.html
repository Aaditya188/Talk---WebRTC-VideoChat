				We limit ourselves to collect the smallest amount of user data that we need to create a seamless experience when
				using Talk. This data includes
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceCandidate" target="_blank">
					RTCICECandidates
				</a>
				&
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCSessionDescription" target="_blank">
					RTCSessionDescription
				</a>
				which is needed to establish the video call using WebRTC, your name & chat for a messaging experience inside the
				app. RTCICECandidates & RTCSessionDescription is not stored in any persistent database, it's removed from the
				server as soon as the user leaves the call by closing the browser window. Your chat messages, video & audio are
				all 100% peer-to-peer, meaning they never touch our server at all. We also collect your name which will be
				stored on your browser and used to identify the chat messages you send.
			</p>
			<p>
				Talk is purely peer-to-peer, which means the user's video & audio is not sent to our server at all. We use
				Google Analytics to track aggregated usage statistics to improve our service.
			</p>
			<p>
				The makers of Talk have no intention of using personally or selling any of the above-mentioned data.
